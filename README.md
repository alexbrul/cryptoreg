# Online store management and payment system
## Introduction
The global south includes huge areas where access to stable connections are lacking. Small businesses are very low-tech, and their socio-economic situation reflects the local need for low entry business management solutions. While there currently are physical cash registry alternatives, these often require a fee for recieving paymenets through Mastercard etc, and a subscription, which small businesses shouldn't have to pay. 

## Proposal
I propose an open source - low entry, alternative that can benefit all kind of businesses, ranging from street hair cutters, to medium sized food markets. It will allow them to recieve paymetns through the blockchain, but also keeping their store inventory and statistics under control. 

### Reflection and future expansion
This prototype is small, and the only connection to the blockchain is payment. Why would you need such a platform to actually be on a blockchain? 

- The future of the internet in such contries is very unstable, and I want this to be able to shared through nodes connected to the network. 
- Connection to the blockchain can assist in restocking and automation of the store. Several stores can in theory be connected and markedplaces can be implemented to show what other stores buy for, sell for, and also collaborate on bigger orders. 
- While crypto is decentraliced and unregulated, it's important for contries and businesses to actually prove they sell what they sell and follow local tax and regulation.
